# Metal Gear Solid Noesis Plugin


This is a plugin for [Noesis](https://richwhitehouse.com/index.php?content=inc_projects.php&showproject=91) which allows the user to view textured 3D Models and animations from PS1 version of the game Metal Gear Solid.

##  Usage.

Drag the dll file into the plugins folder of your Noesis folder, run noesis and find and locate the KMD file you wish to view. Textures will be applied automatically from their respective Dar files. It is best to use [Rex](https://github.com/Jayveer/Rex) to extract the files so they are in the correct folders and format.

There is only one option which when checked allows you to load Oar animation files for the model if it has bones.

##### Prompt for Motion Archive
This option will allow you to choose an Oar file after the model has loaded. This allows you to view animations provided the bones match.
